## Installation
For installation, make sure to install NPM in the root directory and you will need software (I have been using Docker) to initialize your database. Initialize the migration.sql to create the tables and seed them with some basic premade characters. Run node (or nodemon) on expressServer.js to start up the server, which will be listening on port 3000 by default if run locally, or will find the environment port setting if deployed. For the server, you will need to either code in your own "pool" information or create a js file to handle the connections. Once the database and server are up and running, the index.html will be your entry point for client-side which is linked to app.js and index.css.

## Usage
This app is for entertainment purposes and would be used in support of Warhammer 40k campaigns or Wrath and Glory TTRPG campaigns.
